    <h3>We're a start-up that does something</h3>
    <p>Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.</p>
    <p>Galada is a Bengali and Latin font that started with the famous Latin Lobster font, and extended the design to Bengali. The Bengali was developed as a studio collaboration by Jeremie Hornus, Yoann Minet, and Juan Bruce.

The Galada project is led by Black Foundry, a type design foundry based in Paris, France. To contribute, see <a href="https://github.com/BlackFoundryCom/Galada">Github</a></p>
